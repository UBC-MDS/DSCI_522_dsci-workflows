To create the PDF file of the jupyter notebook, you need to copy all the files into a directory and run this command in the terminal:

`jupyter nbconvert --to pdf --template report.tplx report.ipynb`

## Requirements (work in progress)

You will likely need to install some dependencies, including a big one, latex. I adapted instructions from [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ipython/nbconvert-examples/blob/master/citations/Tutorial.ipynb) but those instructions are actually out of date.
